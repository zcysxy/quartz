# High-Dimensional Probability

High-dimensional probability theory studies a high-dim random vector $X\in\R^{n}$ and its transformation (high-dim functions). Without any additional structure, there is nothing special about this random vector. In high-dim probability, we always assume $X$ has **independent** (or **weakly** dependent) coordinates, i.e., $X = (X_{1},\dots,X_{n})$ where $X_{i}$ are independent random variables.
Suppose $X_i$ are iid, the very first result we have is regarding its variance:
$$
\Var(X) = \Cov(X_{1},\dots,X_n) = n\Var(X_{1}).
$$
Such a factorization into the dimension $n$ and one-dim property is called ==tensorization==, a key technique in high-dimensional probability.

For the transformation of such high-dim random vectors, high-dimensional probability theory studies **high-dimensional functions** of the form
$$
f(X_{1},\dots,X_n).
$$
Provided that $f$ is "smooth" enough, we expect [[High Dimensional Probability#Concentration of Measure]], i.e., $f(X) \approx \mathbb{E}[f(X)]$.
Provided that $f$ is not too "complex", we can express it as a [[High Dimensional Probability#Suprema of Stochastic Processes]], and bound its expectation by its "complexity".

## Concentration of Measure

Consider the simplest form: $f(x_{1},\dots,x_n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$. If $\{ X_{i} \}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ is IID and has a finite mean, by the strong [[Central Limit Theorem]], we know $f(X) \overset{a.s.}{\to} \mathbb{E}[X_{1}]$. We ask

## Suprema of Stochastic Processes

The prevalence of suprema is related to the ==variational principle==, which transform the original problem into an [[Optimization]] problem, with the original solution corresponding to a supremum.

> [!thm] Informal Principle
If $t\mapsto Y_{t}$ is "smooth", then $\mathbb{E}[\sup_{t\in T}Y_t]$  can be controlled by the complexity of $T$.
