# *Sufficient* of Statistics

Statistics is a **problem-solving procedure**:

## Probability and Statistics

```mermaid
graph LR
A(Data generating process) --Probability--> B(Observed data)
B --Statistical inference--> A
```

[[Probability]] answers the following question:

> [!qn] Given a data generating process, what are the properties of the outcomes?

While statistical inference answers the inverse problem:

> [!qn] Given the outcomes, what can we say about the process that generated the data?
